## 5) System
Components that work together to achieve a goal by accepting input, processing it, and producing output in an organized manner.

### ● Components of a System:
   **○ Inputs and Outputs**:
A major objective of a system is to produce an output that has value to its user. In order to get a good output, inputs to system must be appropriate.

   **○ Processing:**
It is the element of a system that involves the actual transformation of input into output. It is the operational component of a system. Processors may modify the input totally or partially, depending on the specifications of the output.

   **○ Control:**
The control elements guide the system. It is the decision-making subsystem that controls the pattern of activities governing input, processing, and output.

   **○ Feedback:**
Feedback measures output against a standard in some form of procedure that includes communication and control. Feedback may be positive or negative, routine or informational. Positive feedback reinforces the performance of the system. It is routine in nature. Negative feedback generally provides the controller with information for action.
![[Processing.png]]

   **○ Environment:**
The environment is the “supra-system” within which an organization operates. It is the source of external elements that impinge on the system. In fact, it often determines how a system must function.

   **○ Boundaries and Interfaces:**
A system should be defined by its boundaries- the limits that identify its components, processes, and interrelationships when it interfaces with another system.

### ● Types of System:
   **○ Physical or Abstract Systems:**
      **■ Physical:**
    systems are tangible entities that may be static or dynamic in operation.
      **■ Abstract:**
      systems are conceptual or nonphysical entities. They may be formulas of relationships among sets of variables or models – the abstract conceptualization of physical situations.

   **○ Open or Closed Systems:**
       **■ Open:**
       system has many interfaces with its environment. It permits interaction across its boundaries; it receives inputs from and delivers outputs to the outside.
       **■ closed:**
       system is isolated from environment influences.

   **○ Deterministic and Probabilistic:**
     **■ Deterministic:**
     system is one in which the occurrence of all events is perfectly predictable. If we get the description of the system state at a particular time, the next state can be easily predicted.
     **■ Probabilistic:**
     system is one in which the occurrence of events cannot be perfectly predicted.

### ● System Performance:
   **○ Efficiency:**
     ■ A measure of what is produced divided by what is consumed.

   **○ Effectiveness:**
    ■ A measure of what is achieved divided by the stated goal.

### ● System Variables and Parameters:
   **○ System Variable:**
       ■ A quantity or item that can be controlled by the decision maker (controllable).
          • e.g. selling price

   **○ System Parameter:**
     ■ A value or quantity that cannot be controlled by the decision maker.
        • e.g. raw material costs

   ○ Users at this level make structured decisions. This means that they have defined rules that guide them while making decisions.

### ● Tactical Management Level:
   ○ Middle-level managers, heads of departments, supervisors, dominate this organization level. The users at this level usually oversee the activities of the users at the operational management level.

   ○ Tactical users make semi-structured decisions. The decisions are partly based on set guidelines and judgmental calls.

### ● Strategic Management Level
   ○ This is the most senior level in an organization. The users at this level make unstructured decisions. Senior level managers are concerned with the long-term planning of the organization. They use information from tactical managers and external data to guide them when making unstructured decisions

## 10) Management information system {MIS}
### ● The output from a transaction processing system is used as input to a management information system.

### ● The MIS system analyzes the input with routine algorithms i.e. aggregate, compare and summarizes the results to produced reports that tactical managers use to monitor, control, and predict future performance.

   ○ For example, input from a point of sale system can be used to analyze trends of products that are performing well and those that are not performing well. This information can be used to make future inventory orders i.e. increasing orders for well-performing products and reduce the orders of products that are not performing well.
