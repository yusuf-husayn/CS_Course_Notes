# Network Devices

1) Network Interface Card / NIC / Network Adapter

■ Ethernet 10 mb/s
■ Fast Ethernet 100 mb/s
■ Giga Ethernet 1000 mb/s

## MAC Address (Physical == Inalterable)
![[MAC.png]]

○ MAC Address ==> Media Access Control Address
○ IEEE ==> Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

2) Hub & Switch

## Signal Types

○ Single: transmission in one direction only.
○ Half duplex: transmission in the two directions but not at the same time.
Eg: Hub

○ Full duplex: transmission in the two directions at the same time.

● Data is transported over a network by three methods:

○ Unicast: Type of information transfer is useful when there is a participation of a single sender and a single recipient. So, in short, you can term it a one-to-one transmission.

○ Broadcast: Broadcasting transfer (one-to-all) techniques can be classified into two types:

■ Limited Broadcasting: Suppose you have to send a stream of packets to all the devices over the network that your reside, this broadcasting comes in handy. For this to achieve, it will append 255.255.255.255 (all the 32 bits of IP address set to 1) called Limited Broadcast Address in the destination address of the datagram (packet) header which is reserved for information transfer to all the recipients from a single client (sender) over the network.

■ Direct Broadcasting: This is useful when a device in one network wants to transfer packet stream to all the devices over the other network. This is achieved by translating all the Host ID part bits of the destination address to 1, referred to as Direct Broadcast Address in the datagram header for information transfer.

○ Multicast: In multicasting, one/more senders and one/more recipients participate in data transfer traffic. In this method traffic recline between the boundaries of unicast (one-to-one) and broadcast (one-to-all). Multicast lets servers direct single copies of data streams that are then simulated and routed to hosts that request it. IP multicast requires the support of some other protocols like IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol), Multicast routing for its work. Also in Classful IP addressing Class D is reserved for multicast groups.

## Difference Between Hub and Switch

| Comparison        | Hub         | Switch                        |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Layer             | Layer 1     | Layer 2                       |
| Transmission mode | Half Duplex | Full Duplex                   |
| Casting Type      | Broadcast   | Unicast, Multicast, Broadcast |
