# Types of Network :

## The most two common types of network infrastructures are :

○ LAN ==> Local Area Network

○ WAN ==> Wide Area Network

## Other types of network include :

○ CAN ==> Campus Area Network

○ MAN ==> Metropolitan Area Network

○ PAN ==> Personal Area Network
○ WLAN ==> Wireless Local Area Network
○ SAN ==> Storage Area Network
○ POLAN ==> Passive Optical Local Area Network

## Difference between LAN, CAN, MAN, and WAN in Tabular form

| LAN                                                    | CAN                                                    | MAN                                                                              | WAN                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| LAN stands for Local Area Network                      | CAN stands for Campus Area Network                     | MAN stands for Wide Area Network                                                 | WAN stands for Wide Area Network                |
| Connects computers and workstations in office or home. | Connects two or more LANs within a campus              | Interconnects network in a town or a city.                                       | Connects geographically separated LANs.         |
| Covers a local area of 1 KM.                           | It covers privately owned campus with an area of 5 KM. | It covers larger area than LAN but small area than WAN with an area 2 to 100 km. | Spans Large geographical area more than 100 KM. |
